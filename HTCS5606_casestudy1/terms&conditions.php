Conditions Relating to the Sale of Products to You<br><br>

This section deals with conditions relating to the sale of products by The Pet Meal to you.<br><br>

    <h2>8. Our contract<br><br></h2>

Our contract will be on these terms and conditions to the exclusion of all other terms and conditions (including any terms and conditions which you purport to apply under any purchase order, confirmation email, specification or other document or transmission).<br><br>

The Pet Meal will endeavour to ensure that the supply of products through our Website complies with the relevant laws on veterinary medicines, as amended from time to time.<br><br>

When you place an order to purchase a product from The Pet Meal, we will send you an e-mail acknowledging your order and containing the details of your order. However, please note this does not mean that your order has been accepted.<br><br>

Your order represents an offer to us to purchase a product which is accepted by us when we send e-mail confirmation to you that we've dispatched that product to you (the “Order has been shipped” Confirmation E-mail). That acceptance will be complete and the contract between us will only be formed at the time we send the “Order has been shipped” Confirmation E-mail to you. Any products on the same order which we have not confirmed in a “Order has been shipped” Confirmation E-mail to have been dispatched do not form part of that contract.<br><br>

If we are unable to supply you with a product, for example because that product is no longer in stock or no longer available because of an error on our site (including without limitation an error regarding the price or the nature of the product you ordered) we will inform you by email and will not process your order. If you have already paid for the products, we will refund you the full amount as soon as possible.<br><br>

We reserve the right to cancel orders at any time where we reasonably suspect that you have not acted wholly in accordance with these terms and conditions.<br><br>

    <h2>9. Price and Payment<br><br></h2>

Price shown will be inclusive of VAT but exclusive of delivery costs.<br><br>

The prices of the products will be as quoted from time to time on our website, subject to clause 13 below. Payment for the products is due immediately upon the placing of your order. To place an order, you will be directed to the checkout page. Should you wish to place an order online, you will be required to complete an order form and pay by credit/debit card. Alternatively, you can order products by contacting Pet Supermarket by telephone. By placing an order by telephone you are agreeing to be bound by these terms.<br><br>

No payment shall be deemed to have been received and no delivery will take place until The Pet Meal receives cleared funds.<br><br>

'RRP' means the resale price of a product recommended by the manufacturer or supplier.<br><br>
The Pet Meal only specify the product RRP where this has been disclosed by the manufacturer or supplier.<br><br>


<h2>10. Pricing and availability<br><br></h2>

If an item is not available at the time of ordering, this will be mentioned as “out of stock” on the product information page. As we process your order, we will inform you by e-mail if any products you order turn out to be unavailable. Please note that dispatch estimates are just that. They are not guaranteed dispatch times and should not be relied upon as such.<br><br>

Despite our efforts, a small number of the products in our catalogue are mispriced. Rest assured, however, that we verify prices as part of our dispatch procedures. If a product's correct price is lower than our stated price, we charge the lower amount and send you the product. If a product's correct price is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before dispatch or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.<br><br>

    <h2>11. Product quality<br><br></h2>

We are under a legal duty to supply goods to you that are in conformity with the contract between us.<br><br>

The images of the products on our site are for illustrative purposes only. Although we have made every effort to display the colours accurately, we cannot guarantee that your computer’s display of the colours accurately reflects the colour of the products. Your products may vary slightly from those images.<br><br>

The Pet Meal will endeavour to deliver Food products that are not due to expire within a reasonable period of time of the date of delivery.<br><br>

It is your responsibility to store, use and maintain the products as outlined in the manufacturer datasheet/written instructions.<br><br>

If you discover a defect in the product as a result of damage in transit, you are obliged to give us written notice of the defect within two business days of the time you discovered or ought to have discovered the defect. In such a case, The Pet Meal will request the product to be returned for examination. If the product is deemed defective as a result of transit, The Pet Meal will provide you with the same product or a refund.<br><br>

The Pet Meal will not incur any responsibility if you fail to store the products appropriately, use them after their expiry date or use a product damaged in transit without having informed The Pet Meal.<br><br>

Repeat Orders - Terms and Conditions (‘Repeat Order Terms’)<br><br>
These terms and conditions govern the relationship between us and the customer (‘you’, ‘your’) in respect of your repeat orders, in addition to our usual Terms and Conditions, Privacy Notice and any other legal terms on our website.  By placing a repeat order, you are agreeing to these terms.<br><br>

In the event of a conflict between these Repeat Order Terms, and any other of our terms, these Repeat Order Terms will prevail.<br><br>

Setting up Your Repeat Orders<br><br>

Repeat orders are available on products where indicated on the product page. You will be able to set up your repeat order on the cart or checkout page, selecting how often you would like to receive your repeat product (from 1 week to 1 year).<br><br>

If you set up multiple repeat orders on the same day, at the same frequency, we may group these into one repeat order. If the orders have different delivery options, the cheapest delivery option selected will automatically be applied to the grouped order.<br><br>

Your subscription will continue until cancelled in the manner set out below.<br><br>

Each repeat order is a separate contract by law. The contract is concluded when your order is dispatched and you are sent confirmation of dispatch.<br><br>

Price of the Products<br><br>

For your first order, the price of the products will be the price displayed on the website at the time you place the order.<br><br>

For subsequent recurring deliveries, the applicable price will be the price of the product at the time payment is taken (approximately 5 days after you are emailed to remind you about your order (“Reminder Email”)).<br><br>

You may select express delivery for your first order. For subsequent repeat orders the same delivery method will automatically be selected.<br><br>

Any discount codes or specific promotions applied to your first order not apply to subsequent recurring orders.<br><br>

Order Process<br><br>

After your first order, the repeat order will be automatically placed at your selected interval, using the same payment method used to set up the recurring order. You will be sent a Reminder Email 5 days before payment is taken to confirm that the order is being placed at which stage you will have the following options:<br><br>

Do nothing and receive your order as specified in the email;<br><br>
Amend frequency of order;<br><br>
Edit quantity of ordered products; or<br><br>
Cancel your repeat orders altogether.<br><br>
These actions can be performed up to 5 days after your Reminder Email within your customer account area.<br><br>

Your payment will be taken 5 days after your Reminder Email, and dispatch usually occurs 2-3 days after payment (depending on the delivery option selected on your first order).<br><br>

If you card is nearing expiry, expired, or otherwise fails to process, the order will fail to go through and we will try to contact you. Similarly, if your order fails for any other reason (for example the product is out of stock or your address is not recognised) our customer contact centre will get in touch.<br><br>

Repeat orders may be returned in accordance with our usual returns policy.<br><br>

Cancellation or Changes<br><br>

You can make changes to your subscription as per the bullet points above at any time in your customer account online.<br><br>

You can cancel your recurring order at any time by contacting our customer care team . Please be aware, it may not be possible to cancel your recurring order once payment has been taken (although customer care will do their best to help you if you phone them!)<br><br>

Please note we may cancel your recurring order for any reason in our sole discretion, including if the ordered product is discontinued.<br><br>

Alteration of Service or Amendments to the Repeat Order Terms<br>

We reserve the right to alter, suspend or terminate the repeat orders scheme at any time by updating the relevant website page.<br><br>

We also reserve the right to amend these Repeat Order Terms at any time by updating this page. You will be subject to the Repeat Order Terms in force at the time that each order is placed.<br><br>

The Pet Meal(“Pet Supermarket”, “us” or “we”) knows that you care how information about you is used and shared and we appreciate your trust in us to do that carefully and sensibly. This notice describes the information gathering and dissemination practice for this website.<br><br>

By visiting thepetmeal.co.nz, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this Privacy Notice.<br><br>

Controller of Personal Information<br>
The Pet Meal is the trading name created by Shweta Das,<br><br>

Any personal information provided to or gathered by The Pet Meal is controlled and processed by or on behalf of The Pet Meal.

This website is operated and controlled by Shweta Das.

What Personal Information About Customers Does The Pet Meal Gather?
The information we learn from customers helps us personalise and continually improve your shopping experience at thepetmeal.co.nz. We use the information to handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products, services and promotional offers, update our records and generally maintain your account with us and recommend products and services that might be of interest to you. We also use this information to improve our store and platform, prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our website and enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our behalf.

Here are the types of information we gather:

Information You Give Us: You provide such information when you search, buy, post, participate in a questionnaire or communicate with our customer care team. For example, you provide information when you: search for a product; place an order through thepetmeal.co.nz; provide information in your account (and you might have more than one if you have used more than one e-mail address when shopping with us); communicate with us by phone, e-mail or otherwise; complete a questionnaire. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information as: your name; address and phone number; credit card information; your pet’s name, age and weight; people to whom purchases have been shipped (including addresses and phone numbers); content of reviews and e-mails to us; and financial information.<br><br>

Automatic Information: Examples of the information we collect and analyse include: the Internet Protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login; e-mail address; password; computer and connection information such as browser type and version; operating system and platform; purchase history, which we sometimes aggregate with similar information from other customers to create features; the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through and from our website (including date and time); cookie number; products you viewed or searched for; any phone number used to call our customer service number. We may also use browser data such as cookies, Flash cookies (also known as Flash Local Shared Objects), or similar data on certain parts of our website for fraud prevention and other purposes. During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.<br><br>

Information from Other Sources: Examples of information we receive from other sources include: updated delivery and address information from our carriers or other third parties, which we use to correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communicate more easily; account information, purchase or redemption information and page-view information from some merchants with which we operate co-branded businesses or for which we provide technical, fulfilment, advertising or other services; search term and search result information; and credit history information from credit reference agencies, which we use to help prevent and detect fraud and to offer certain credit or financial services to some customers.<br><br>

What about Cookies?<br><br>

Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our site. For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them see our Cookie Policy.<br><br><br>



Does The Pet Meal Share the Information it Receives?<br>

Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling it to others. The Pet Meal shares customer information only as described below.<br>


Promotional Offers: Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of The Pet Meal customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, the other business will not contact you directly and we will only share your personal data to the extent (if at all) required to share these promotions with you.<br><br>

Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions, customer information is generally one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Kokoba Ltd or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. In addition, Pet Supermarket may disclose customer information to its subsidiaries or other affiliated entities. In any of these cases you accept and consent that Pet Supermarket assign, transfer, and/or share your personal information for purposes of continuing to provide its services according to the terms of this Privacy Notice.<br><br>

Protection of The Pet Meal and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use & Sale and other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of Pet Supermarket, our users or others. This includes providing information to our regulators and releasing information for the purposes of complying with relevant veterinary medicines regulations, guidance and any other rules or notes, as amended from time to time. This also includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in a way that is contrary to the commitments made in this Privacy Notice.<br><br>

With your consent: other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.<br><br>

Whenever we transfer personal information to countries outside of  Area in the course of sharing information as set out above, we will ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by the applicable laws on data protection.<br><br>

Is my Information Protected?<br><br>

The Pet Meal has implemented security policies, rules and technical measures to protect your personal data from unauthorised access or modification, improper use or disclosure, unlawful destruction or accidental loss.<br><br>

We do not reveal your credit card number when confirming an order, nor do we store or log your entire credit card number. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company the first time a card is added. This generates a ‘token’ (which we store, together with the last 3 digits of your card number) in order to process subsequent orders.<br><br>

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of personally identifiable customer information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you. It is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when you finish using a shared computer.<br><br>

All our employees and data processors, who have access to, and are associated with the processing of personally identifiable customer information are obliged to respect the confidentiality of our customers.<br><br>

We will ensure that your personal data will not be disclosed to state institutions and authorities without your consent except if we are required to do so in order to comply with any legal obligation, to prevent or detect crime, or catch and prosecute a suspect, or pursuant to a subpoena or any other law enforcement procedure or investigation.<br><br>

What About Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites?<br>
Our site may include third-party advertising and links to other websites. We do not provide any personally identifiable customer information to these advertisers or third-party websites.<br><br>


These third-party websites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to send (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on our website directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalise advertising content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices.<br><br>

Accessing and Changing Your Information<br>

Pet Supermarket gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with Pet Supermarket for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. This list will change as our website evolves.<br>
You can request access to the information that we hold about you and correct or update any such information which would not be accurate. Some information may be accessed simply by logging onto your account. Examples of information you can access easily online include: up-to-date information regarding recent orders; personally identifiable information (including name, e-mail, and password). For accessing any other information not available in your account, you may contact us at sales@pet-supermarket.co.uk.<br><br>

Data Retention<br><br>

We will retain the personal information we collect from you in accordance with our data retention policy as set out below.<br><br>

You can close your account through the Pet-supermarket.co.uk website or by contacting our customer service team. If you close your The Pet Meal account, we will mark your account in our database as “closed”, but will keep some of your account information in our database for up to 10 years, after which time it will be deleted irretrievably. This is necessary in order to deter fraud, by ensuring that persons who try to commit fraud will not be able to avoid detection simply by closing their account and opening a new one. We will also retain your prescription order history. We are required to keep this information for at least five years by our regulators. However, if you close your account, your personally identifiable information will be put beyond use. This means that it will not be used by us for any further purposes, nor sold or shared with third parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement, as required by law.<br><br>
