9. Returns

We understand that on occasion you want to return an item you purchased from us. We are striving to make this process quick and convenient for you.

For more information on returns or to request a return / refund, call us on 0844 809 9907 or email sales@pet-supermarket.co.uk.

Medicines

Unfortunately, due to regulatory law, we cannot accept the return of any medication including flea and worming treatments. If you return such a medication to us, we can dispose of this for you but are not authorised to resell this. If an order containing medicinal products is faulty, we will accept returns within 60 days of the order date.

Other Products

If for any reason you are not satisfied with any product you purchased from us, you can return by notifying us within 14 calendar days of receipt. The product must be returned within 14 calendar days of your notification to us in its original packaging, unopened and in condition for resale.

You can use the model instructions for cancellation found here

We only accept returns of products that have been purchased through our site.

If the product arrives in bad condition, or if for some reason the return is the result of an error on our part, we will resend or refund the product (in our sole discretion) within 60 days of the order date.

Any return that does not meet the above conditions may not be refunded or replaced.

Unless the product is faulty or not as described, you will be responsible for the cost of returning the products to us. If we have agreed to collect the products from you, we will charge you the cost to us of collection.

If you cancel your contract we will:



(a) refund you the price you paid for the products. However, please note we are permitted by law to reduce your refund to reflect any reduction in the value of the goods, if this has been caused by your handling them in a way which would not be permitted in a shop;



(b) refund any delivery costs you have paid, although, as permitted by law, the maximum refund will be the costs of delivery by the least expensive delivery method we offer. For example, if we offer standard delivery at one cost but you chose to have premium delivery at a higher cost, then we will only refund what you would have paid for the cheaper delivery option; and



(c) make any refunds due to you as soon as possible and in any event within the deadlines indicated below:



a. if you have received the product and we have not offered to collect it from you: 14 days after the day on which we receive the product back from you or, if earlier, the day on which you provide us with evidence that you have sent the product back to us; or



b. if you have not received the product or have received it and we have offered to collect it from you: 14 days after you inform us of your decision to cancel the contract.
11. Delivery

Upon receipt of your order for products not requiring a written prescription or receipt of your signed prescription for your prescription only medicines products, Pet Supermarket will use reasonable endeavour to deliver your products to you within 7 working days.

Where Pet Supermarket is unable to deliver your products within 30 days from the day of receipt of your order, or as applicable, signed prescription, Pet Supermarket will advise you by email of the reason for the delay and provide a revised date for the delivery.

If for any reason you do not accept delivery of any of the products or Pet Supermarket is unable to deliver the products on time because you have not provided the appropriate instructions, Pet Supermarket may attempt to deliver the product again in which case you will be liable for all reasonable related costs and expenses.

If you do not accept delivery of any of the products because you have cancelled the contract pursuant to Clause 10 above you will receive a refund or credit for any sum that has been paid by you for the products within 30 days of cancellation less any premium delivery costs, less any cost Pet Supermarket incurs for collection of the product.

The products will be under your risk and responsibility from completion of delivery.

However, you will only own the products once we have received payment in full, including all applicable delivery charges.

Please note that some couriers may leave the products with a neighbour, or in a place on your property which they consider to be a ‘safe place’ if you are not in.
